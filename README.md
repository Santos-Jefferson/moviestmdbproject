# Movies TMDB Project

### Instructions:

1. Git clone this repository
2. Install node.js
3. Install express running: npm install express
4. Start the webservice executing the server.js file inside the webservice folder, running: node server.js
5. Start the webapp, changing to the webapp folder and running the following command: npm run dev
6. Webserver runs on port 3001 and Webapp runs on port 3000
7. When the search button is hit from the webapp, the console log from webservice will bring the results from the TMDB API


### Final Considerations:

The last time I used Node.js and Express was in one of my classes at BYU-Idaho, probably more than 7 years ago. I did some research and read the documentation to refresh some concepts and conclude the project partially. I never used before Vue.js and Nuxt.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to conclude the whole project. The next steps that should be implemented are:
 - Finish the front-end part to display the Title, Image of the Poster, Popularity summary, etc. For now, the full API results are displayed only on the console log.
 - Filter the API results to 10 items only and to the items to be displayed at the front-end
 - Thanks for the opportunity!
